Last year I blogged as well, and this year, I'm doing more of the same! Hooray!

## Thanks are in order
Thanks for the laughs and many inside jokes to my travel companions and colleagues [Frans Guelinckx](), [Steven Op de Beeck](). [Imanuel Rennen](), [Tom Briers]() and [Nathan Vandecauter]().

Thanks also go out to our employer, [Cegeka](http://www.cegeka.com), who paid for travel, accomodation and the entrance fee (for -let's be honest- a lot of people).

Thanks to the organizers, [White October Events](http://www.whiteoctoberevents.co.uk), who once again did an _amazing_ job at making everyone feel right at home and safe.

And thanks to [Meri Williams](http://twitter.com/@Geek_Manager), with her witty announcements, for being the perfect host and an inspiring example to us all.

## Day 1 - Tech Leads, Feedback, and what not
### Patrick Kua - The constant life of a tech lead <a name="#Patrick_Kua">&nbsp;</a>
Last year I learned that [Patrick](http://twitter.com/patkua) is great at doing keynotes, so seeing him again as first speaker on day 1 was no surprise. Especially since it was on the schedule ;)

Pat focused his talk around three main parts of a Lead Developer: Tech, People and System.

#### Tech
He showed this nice graph of how multiple languages arose over time (starting with cobol, ending with Go). Restating that technology will always change and so, learning new technology (e.g. languages) is a certainty in our line of business.

However, when learning new technology, it should be ones focus to distill the principles that a new technology holds, not just the superficial parts like syntax.
Because it's the principles that are transferrable to another technology.

For example, even though pure functional languages are really different from Object Oriented ones, you can still benefit from proper modularization. Same goes for the principle of code smells.

As an even better example, he mentioned the relevance of this paper on _information hiding_:
[On the criteria to be used in decomposing systems into ~modules~ services](https://www.cs.umd.edu/class/spring2003/cmsc838p/Design/criteria.pdf)

In short (read: butchered), it's about how you slice a system, will dictate whether or not you get the benefits of the flexibility.

Even though it's been around for a really long time, it's still relevant today. Because it's supported by a principle.

So next time you're learning something new you should be asking yourself _What can I learn which I can use in a different context, in a different tool?_

This tooooootally hit home for me. As it did in some other talks as well. This is the idea of _Forwards and Backwards Reaching Transfer_. Something that I did a presentation on nearly 5 years ago. I think it's time I pick up this idea again and really do something with it.

#### People
_Don't be a maker, be a multiplier._

Accept your role as Lead Dev and don't just focus on making stuff anymore. Pay forward your knowledge and mentor people, in order to _multiply_ your ideas, etc.

Read about how people really differ: [Strengthsfinder (2.0)](https://www.amazon.com/StrengthsFinder-2-0-Tom-Rath/dp/159562015X).

[Hofstede's cultural dimensions.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstede%27s_cultural_dimensions_theory)

Simon Wardly's maps. Pioneers, Settlers, Town Planners

He briefly touched on diversity as well. In that diversity in and of itself is not necessarily beneficial. It's strength only works when you allow it. 

I think what he meant by that is that creating a diverse team of itself isn't enough. Your job is to enable and maintain a safe environment for the diversity to foster. So that diverse ideas pop up automatically. This is no easy task, there is a danger of stereotypes popping up, instead of thinking of archetypes.

#### System
I was glad to hear this being said out loud: _There will never be enough time_ (to learn all the stuffs).

There is SO much information to consume, and knowing what's worth it, is going to be half the battle.

To help us in our fight he shared with us the _Eisenhower matrix_ for more efficient time management. And proposed setting a time-boxed and scheduled moment for consuming social media.

He then talked a bit about Double loop learning, but that didn't sink in as good as it should I don't think. It seems too simple.

Instead of some Action having a Result, where that Result feeds back into your next Action (Single loop), which is a very reactive way of learning about things. You should Act from a Mental Model, which Action causes a Result that then feeds back into your Mental Model again and your next Action.

It sounded like _Think before you Act_, and also his topic about reusing principles when you think about it. These principles **are** the Mental Model from which you try to Act.

Something important he added though, is that you can also improve Mental Models via coaching (being coached). It's paramount for Lead Devs to get your mentees to that _Aha_ moment, so they can improve their Mental Model.


### Dominika Rogala - Things you wish you shared with your team before they agreed on that deadline <a name="#Dominika_Rogala">&nbsp;</a>
Deadlines are known to get missed. But is there a way to prevent this from happening?

Dominika asked us these questions, and I'd like for you to give answers to these as well.

How many days are there in a year? ... How many in a week?

If you answered 365 and 7, you'd be wrong. 

There's about 250 workdays in a year, and that's without counting holidays.

Same for days in a week, there are only 5. Now think about how much of one day you can actually get work done. That means focused, non-interrupted work. So absolutely no context-switches, no mails, meetings, ...

This was eye opening to me, especially because it seems so trivial. She also gave a very clear example of the _I'll do it in the meantime_ myth. Something I intend to pay attention to next time I find myself responding with that very sentence.

There was also this fine example of how assuming that ordering electronics parts in China during februari _is going to be fine_. When there's something like _Chinese New Year_ and all shops are closed for 2 weeks. Specifically she called this the unpredictability trap. I think in general you can classify it under assumption. It'll be easier to think about whether or not your assuming something.

Then she talked about this thing called _common priority_. For example, for Christmas dinner, everyone is always _on time_ because there's this common intent of being together. But when there is none defined, the _default priority_ kicks in. This is an individual one though, which leads to more assumption and miscommunications.

For example, if you don't communicate that you'd rather get the guaranteed delivery on a shipment, than the cheaper delivery, your team might think they're doing you a favor in cutting costs. Where you might miss a deadline because delivery got delayed.

So next time you need to estimate something, make sure that the ones estimating know:

* what time they have
* what traps they can fall into
* and what the common priorities are

Make sure **they** know, what **you** know.
